##Published papers using *i*Map4
Our first paper using *i*Map4 is recently published in Scientific Reports:

Bovet, J., Lao, J., & Caldara, R., & Raymond, M. (2016). Mapping females' bodily features of attractiveness. _Scientific Reports, 6,_ 18551; [doi: 10.1038/srep18551](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep18551)  

We provide a subset of the eye movement data as a demo of *i*Map4, see [wiki](https://github.com/iBMLab/iMap4/wiki/Background-of-Example-1)
